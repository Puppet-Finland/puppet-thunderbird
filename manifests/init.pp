# == Class: thunderbird
#
# This class install and configures Mozilla Thunderbird
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*manage*]
#   Manage Mozilla Thunderbird using this module. Valid values 'yes' (default) 
#   and 'no'. This is primarily needed with Hiera where excluding classes 
#   inherited from the lower levels in the hierarchy is not possible.
# [*manage_config*]
#   Manage Mozilla Thunderbird configuration. Valid values 'yes' (default) and 
#   'no'.
# [*locales*]
#   A hash of thunderbird::locale resources to realize. Currently only needed on 
#   Debian and Ubuntu where the locales are packaged separately. Defining these 
#   on other operating systems is harmless.
# [*servers*]
#   A hash of thunderbird::server resources to realize. These are common to all 
#   users on the system.
# [*snmpservers*]
#   A hash of thunderbird::snmpserver resources to realize. These are common to 
#   all users on the system.
# [*profiles*]
#   A hash of thunderbird::profile resources to realize. These are 
#   user-specific.
